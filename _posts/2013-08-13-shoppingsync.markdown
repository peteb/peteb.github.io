This is an app that I've been working on for a little bit over a month
now, an app that I can't wait to use myself! It's a grocery
list/shopping list app that syncs across iOS and Android devices, and
you can also access your lists on the Web and from your desktop on Mac.

The syncing functionality is designed to work for collaborating on
lists; marking, adding and deleting items happen on all
devices in realtime. That's a handy feature when you're more than one
doing the shopping, and if you manage the shopping on your own 
you can now access your list basically wherever you are.

Sharing a list is super easy, there's no need to register an account
or remember any passwords. Don't you just *hate* passwords?

Present and future features:

 - iOS, Android, Web and Mac OS X clients
 - Order your lists manually
 - Categories for sorting your items
 - "Shopping mode"

Some technical information:

 - Lists are stored locally and synced whenever possible over a
 REST-ful API
 - Server is implemented using Java EE Servlets running in GlassFish
 on EC2
