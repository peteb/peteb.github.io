The blog has to start somehow, so why not do it by outlining its purpose? There are many purposes, but these ones are mine:

 - I'll tell you a little bit about my projects ...
 - ... and a bit about my business
 - When I find a neat trick or come up with a nifty solution, I might write about that too

I will not write about the following:

 - Politics. I used to be interested, but it's just not worth it anymore
 - Cute kittens. Sorry!
 - My personal life (I'll spare you)

This means that I won't be writing 5 posts a day, probably not even close to 5 posts a month, but I hope that when I do, it'll be something I'm excited about.
