    Hi! I'm Peter and I'm a program-a-holic; I've been programming stuff since I was 9 or 10 years old and at 25 I still find it very rewarding.
    I'm more than a programmer, though. I'm also something of an inventor; I'm the most happy when I get to design and
    implement a new project. I hope that doesn't sound too pretentious, but creating things is close to heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any projects that you think I could help you out with, don't hesitate to contact me. One of my most important projects right now is to
    shape the future of my consulting business and I'm eager to hear what makes your company tick. 
  </p>

  
  <p>
    Things that I like:

    <ul>
      <li>Ridiculously simple solutions to complex problems</li>
      <li>Emacs, Mac OS X, iPhone, the Open Source + Mac + JavaScript + GitHub Culture<br />
      <small>I've also been known to enjoy working in Linux and survive Windows.</small></li>
      <li>C++, C, Ruby, Scheme, or anything else. I've even begun to like Java <i>EE</i><br /><small>Don't let this fool you though. I'm pretty good with C++, but I also like working in Java and Obj-C.</small></li>
      <li>Web service back-ends, high availability, etc.</li>
      <li>UX&mdash;for being technically inclined, I'm quite picky with my UIs</li>
    </ul>
  </p> 

  <p>
    Things that I've made:

    <ul>
      <li>Cocoa and Cocoa Touch projects, for desktop and iOS devices</li>
      <li>Different kinds of servers; file servers, chat servers, web servers and game servers</li>
      <li>Programming languages; both interpreted and compiled dynamic languages<br />
      <small>My master's thesis is about optimizing dynamic languages on <a href="http://www.llvm.org" target="_blank">LLVM</a>.</small></li>
      <li>Operating system kernels supporting multi-tasking, filesystems, protected memory<br />
      <small>It's all about IRQs, IDTs, DMA, MMUs, PITs and GDTs!</small></li>
      <li>3D games using OpenGL with fancy shader graphics and physics using ODE</li>
      <li>Networked realtime 2D games using UDP. Prediction can be such a mess</li>
    </ul>
